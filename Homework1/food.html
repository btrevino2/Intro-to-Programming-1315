  <li>Almost anything Sweet</li>
  <li>Charuterie boards,<i>I know I'm basic</i></li> <br>

<p>Food has always been such a big part of my life. Most family gathering growing up revolved around food, and I found a love for cooking at a very young age.</p>
<p>Growing up I spent hundreds of hours cooking with my grandmother and watching the Foodnetwork channel together.</p>
What food should I learn to cook next? <input type="text" name="type of food" placeholder="Please enter a food">
