<p> I love spending as much time with my family, friends, and dogs as I can. With me working and going to school full time it is not always easy, but I try to prioritize the <b>people</b> and <i>pets</i> around me as much as possible.</p>
<p>Although I am no longer studying Art, it is still a real passion of mine and I would like to make more time in my life to explore being creative again.</p>

  <p>What should I prioritize more?
